# Dungeons-and-Dragons Post-mortem
## Things we did well
* Communication - we clearly defined roles, so there were less conflicts when branches merged. 
* Collaboration - we each did well sharing screens, and helping each other to search for errors in code. 
* Back End Coding - we solidified our understanding on how to make a good model structure, and a well routed scheme.
* Front End/Back End Integration - we understood the back and forth communication between back end and front end. 

## Things we learned / want to improve
* Travis - we were unable to pass our Travis check, even though we had no errors in our code according to ESLint. 
* Use the Dnd5edapi - get full usage of the api, and create a tool to understand the game more
* Implement a Map - adding a map feature to allow users to connect with other users 
* Allow Users to Make Avatars - when users log in, they can create Avatars for themselves and their characters
* Allow Users to manage their personal playable character
* Share Campaigns between users
* Add ads to get money - links to the professional dice makers.
